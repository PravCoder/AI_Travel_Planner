/*  Create backend endpoints related to user model here, like /login & /register  

1. Need to create a express router called userRouter or something, create a /login endpoint, export that router, and import it in index.js
2. In index.js import this userRouter and do app.use("/", userRouter);, so you can send requests to the endpoints in this file and test your code.
